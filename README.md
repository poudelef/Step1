## Introduction

Over 90% of startups fail, with the lack of market need cited as the #1 reason for failure (CB Insights, 2018). At the heart of this issue is a broken or non-existent customer discovery process. Despite the popularity of frameworks like Lean Startup, most founders still struggle with the how of effective customer interviews.

We recognized that founders often enter interviews with biases, ask leading questions, and hear only what they want to hear. As a result, they build products based on assumptionsâ€”not reality. According to Batova et al. (2016), this overconfidence and lack of qualitative rigor in lean startup customer discovery creates a "validation void" that can doom ventures early.

So, we set out to build something that could help.
